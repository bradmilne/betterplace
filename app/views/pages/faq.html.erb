                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">What are your current available locations?</h3>
                                <p>We currently are offering a rustic location in northern Ontario that we feel best represents the geography of the land. We will soon be expanding to other locations in Canada, the US and overseas. If you have any questions or special requests please <%= link_to "contact us.", new_contact_path %></p>
                                
                                
                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">How do I coordinate the delivery / pickup of the ashes?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Better Place works directly with the funeral home (if that's where the ashes are currently located) or we are available to pick up the ashes from your home. In special cases we can help you coordinate shipping.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">How much does the service cost?</h3>

                                <p>The costs are dependent on the location and pickup or shipping options. Please see our <a href="#">pricing table</a> for details.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can my family visit the area where the ashes will be planted?</h3>
                                
                                <p>It depends on the location but for the most part, Better Place like to choose locations with road access so that you can visit the final resting place of your loved ones.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">How long does it take from the pickup of the ashes to be transferred to the selected location?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Because Better Place chooses locations for their natural habitats, we need to work with nature on logistics. This means we can usually transfer the remains in spring, summer or fall.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Will the locations run out of room?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Yes. Although we will acquire more land as needed. If you would like to reserve a space in a particular location please <%= link_to "contact us.", new_contact_path %></p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can my family visit my tree?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Always. Better Place parks are permanently maintained and accessible for your family and friends to visit you. </p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can I be planted with my loved one in the future?</h3>
                                
                                <p>Yes. Many families create a private grove of trees for their family or choose multiple trees beside each other.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can I choose what type of tree that I would like to be? </h3>
                                
                                <p>Yes, but only native trees that are natural to the location of our wilderness parks are available in each location.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can ashes always be absorbed into nature? </h3>
                                
                                <p>Untreated ashes are harmful to plants due to their high pH balance and sodium content. It's important that ashes are rebalanced with a specific mix of organic compounds so they can naturally break down into organic matter and be absorbed into local plants. </p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Where does Better Place store ashes before they are planted? </h3>
                                
                                <p>Ashes are stored at the funeral home who cared for you or your loved one until they are ready to transported to our memorial park facility. If you already have your loved one's ashes at home, we can pick them up directly from you.</p>

                                <h3 class="section-heading" style="text-align:center !important;">Can I re-sell my location in the future if I haven't used it?</h3>
                                
                                <p>In Ontario, when you reserve a location in our park, you purchase the scattering rights to that location. If you choose to in the future, you are able to re-sell your scattering rights to another person.</p>
